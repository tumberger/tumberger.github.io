      <title>Breaking Barriers: Simplifying Decentralized Onboarding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Permissionless Blockchains offer a compelling solution for novel applications that operate in a permissionless environment. However, they currently face a daunting dichotomy - although they&amp;rsquo;re permissionless, they&amp;rsquo;re notoriously hard to access. Whereas applications that are native to blockchains are already decentralized, users are unable to interact with them without first acquiring cryptocurrency from a centralized, trusted exchange. The process is tedious and error-prone - users need to send funds to often sparsely regulated entities from their own bank account. Further, processes often take multiple days, and incur unfavourable exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to verify Cryptographic Attestation of an AWS Nitro Enclave</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the realm of cloud computing, the assurance of data security and application integrity is of utmost importance. AWS Nitro Enclaves provide a robust mechanism by creating isolated computing environments specifically designed to safeguard and process highly sensitive information. A pivotal aspect of this security framework is the cryptographic attestation process, which enables external entities to verify the authenticity and integrity of the code and data executing within an enclave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revisiting Elliptic Curves, Recursive SNARKs and Folding Schemes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, SNARKs proliferated themselves as a potential privacy and scaling solution for permissionless blockchains.&#xA;However, due to the complexity of underlying cryptography and mathematical constructions, SNARKs are  hard to grasp for application oriented computer scientists and hardware developers.&#xA;In this article, we will give a short introduction to pairing-friendly elliptic curves and how the choice of elliptic curve influences the feasability of constructing a &lt;em&gt;recursive&lt;/em&gt; SNARK, a primitive of primary interest for especially for rollups and incrementally verifiable computation (IVC).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
